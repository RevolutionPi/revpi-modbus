<summary>We have moved to GitLab! Read this for more information.</summary>

We have recently moved our repositories to GitLab. You can find revpi-modbus
here: https://gitlab.com/revolutionpi/revpi-modbus  
All repositories on GitHub will stay up-to-date by being synchronised from
GitLab.

We still maintain a presence on GitHub but our work happens over at GitLab. If
you want to contribute to any of our projects we would prefer this contribution
to happen on GitLab, but we also still accept contributions on GitHub if you
prefer that.

# Upcoming changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * In the function determineNextEvent () the last target time will be the
Period length added to calculate the next execution time.
If the connection was interrupted for a long time, however, they accumulate
many versions of the then with a shorter period length
(tv_earliest_next_trigger_time) are processed. If the cycle times anyway
are already tightly laid out, this can lead to an overload. Must
be changed. The next execution time must be the current time plus
Be cycle time.

# Modbus Function Codes:

Important function codes are marked with '*'.The other function codes may not
need to be supported.

| | Code | ID |
|-|----|------|
|*|    eREAD_COILS               | 0x01|
|*|    eREAD_DISCRETE_INPUTS     | 0x02|
|*|    eREAD_HOLDING_REGISTERS   | 0x03|
|*|    eREAD_INPUT_REGISTERS     | 0x04|
|*|    eWRITE_SINGLE_COIL        | 0x05|
|*|    eWRITE_SINGLE_REGISTER    | 0x06|
| |    eREAD_EXCEPTION_STATUS    | 0x07|
|*|    eWRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS     | 0x0F|
|*|    eWRITE_MULTIPLE_REGISTERS | 0x10|
| |    eREPORT_SLAVE_ID          | 0x11|
| |    eWRITE_MASK_REGISTER      | 0x16|
| |    eWRITE_AND_READ_REGISTERS | 0x17|

Coils and Discrete Inputs are one bit in size. In the process image, however,
one byte should be reserved for each bit.Holding registers and input registers
have a size of 2 bytes.

For each Modbus command, an additional byte must be reserved in the Pi process
image for error messages.

For the virtual device, a byte must also be reserved in the Pi process image for
error messages.

For each Modbus command and the virtual device, a bit must be reserved to reset
the error byte in the Pi process image
